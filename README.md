# Rant by Restless Ape-PIs!

## How to set up environment
* Inside `/health-app`, activate the project environment with the following command: `source venv-rant-app/bin/activate`.
* If you have successfully activated the virtual environment, you should see a `"venv-rant-app"` tag in your terminal. 
* If you want to install any additional libraries, install them into the environment using `pip install <package-name>`. Save your dependencies into `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
